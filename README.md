# Renewable-Energy-Prediction-Model

This repository contains a comprehensive case study on predicting renewable energy production using historical data and weather patterns. The project employs data science techniques, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Highlights:
Synthetic Data Generation: Simulated weather and energy production data for two locations.
Data Preprocessing: Merging datasets, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
Machine Learning: Training a Random Forest Regressor to predict energy production.
Model Evaluation: Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 score for performance assessment.
Visualization: Detailed plots to understand data and model performance, including actual vs predicted values, feature importance, pairplots, distribution plots, and time series plots.
This project demonstrates how data science can enhance the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy sources, providing valuable insights and tools for further research and application.
